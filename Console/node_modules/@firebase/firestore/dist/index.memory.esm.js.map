Once the local store has completed\n * one logical operation, it commits the transaction.\n *\n * When persistent storage is disabled, the non-persistent versions of the\n * mutators ignore the transaction. This short-cut is allowed because\n * memory-only storage leaves no state so it cannot be inconsistent.\n *\n * This simplifies the implementations of the mutators and allows memory-only\n * implementations to supplement the persistent ones without requiring any\n * special dual-store implementation of Persistence.
